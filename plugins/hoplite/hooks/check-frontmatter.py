"""PostToolUse hook: warn when a .md file under docs/ is written without valid Hoplite frontmatter.

Exits 2 with an advisory on stderr so Claude Code surfaces the warning to the agent as
tool-result feedback. The write is not rolled back; the agent is expected to follow up
with an Edit that prepends or corrects the frontmatter block.

Validation is line-scan based — no PyYAML dependency, since the hook runs under
whatever ``python`` is on PATH, not the hoplite project's venv. The indexer at reindex
is the authoritative validator (it parses YAML for real and checks types); this hook
catches the structural issues that are cheap to detect:

- Missing opening ``---`` fence.
- Missing closing ``---`` fence.
- Either of the two mandatory keys (title, summary) absent. Both are bare
  first-class fields; everything in the property bag (``document.created``,
  ``document.tags``, ``document.aliases``, and any ``document.<key>``) is optional.
  The scanner still flattens nested ``document:`` / ``edge:`` blocks to dotted keys,
  mirroring the indexer.

Wrong types, typos in keys, malformed YAML — left to the indexer.

The canonical guidance shown in the advisory is inlined at build time from
``templates/components/shape/frontmatter.md`` so the hook and the writing skills
teach exactly the same shape.

## Frontmatter

Every document in the Hoplite corpus, docs/, opens with a YAML frontmatter block. Hoplite indexes documents through this block; a document with missing or malformed frontmatter generates a warning at reindex (in `WriteResult.warnings`) and stays out of the graph until you fix it.

Every key beyond `title` and `summary` creates one of two things. A **node property** is a fact stored on the document's own graph node — a key with one or more values (`tags`, `created`, `status`). An **edge stereotype** is a labeled link from this document to another — a typed `mentions` edge carrying a name like `blocked_by` or `supports`.

`document` and `edge` are namespaces — they declare which of the two a key creates: `document.` for node properties, `edge.` for edge stereotypes. `title` and `summary` are the exception — they are first-class, FTS-indexed fields, not properties, so they stay **bare**.

Two mandatory fields:

- `title` (string, bare) — short, human-readable name.
- `summary` (string, bare) — one-line lede. `where` and `relatives` return it so callers can scan candidates without opening the file.

Optional fields:

- `document.created` (ISO date string, `YYYY-MM-DD`) — creation date. Stays stable across edits when present.
- `document.tags` (list of strings) — tag slugs the document carries. Use kebab-case lowercase (`graph-db`, not `Graph DB` or `graph_db`); the indexer casefolds for lookup. A document may carry no tags.
- `document.aliases` (list of strings) — alternate paths that resolve to this document; add on rename so wikilinks pointing at the old name still resolve.

`document.tags` and `document.aliases` are lists and follow the omit-when-empty rule: include the key only when it carries at least one element, otherwise leave it out.

Beyond the mandatory fields, any `document.<key>` becomes a node property and any `edge.<stereotype>: [paths]` becomes a stereotyped `mentions` edge — Hoplite accepts and stores them. Examples: `document.status: draft`, `document.priority: high`, `document.due: 2026-06-01`, `edge.blocked_by: [docs/notes/foo.md]`. External tools like Obsidian or Dataview read them too. Only `title` and `summary` are bare; everything else is prefixed.

### Namespace spelling and list spelling

A key carries spelling freedom on two independent axes — the namespace on the left, the list value on the right.

The **namespace** (`document`, `edge`) can be written two ways, and Hoplite normalizes both to the same key before indexing:

- **Dotted** — `document.tags: [...]`. The namespace is part of the key.
- **Nested** — a `document:` mapping with its keys indented underneath. Reads cleaner when a document carries several properties.

YAML treats these as different structures — `document.tags` is one key with a dot in its name; the nested form is a mapping under `document`. Hoplite's parser flattens the mapping to the dotted key, so the two are equivalent by Hoplite's rule, not YAML's. Neither is preferred. A file can mix them — a nested `document:` block alongside dotted `edge.<stereotype>` lines. `title` and `summary` stay bare in both forms.

A **list value** accepts any valid YAML sequence — flow or block are identical here, because YAML itself parses them to the same list:

```yaml
document.tags: [note, design]
```

```yaml
document.tags:
  - note
  - design
```

`document.tags`, `document.aliases`, and every `edge.<stereotype>` must be sequences. Any other `document.<key>` may be a bare scalar — `document.status: draft` stores as a single-value property, the same as `document.status: [draft]`.

### Tags classify; properties carry state

A tag answers "what is this document?" — its type, classification, the shape of artifact it represents. Tags are immutable once applied. Removing one erases the document's identity as that kind of artifact and breaks queries that rely on the classification.

A property answers "what state is this document in?" Fields that change as the lifecycle progresses (`document.status` moving from `open` to `closed`, `document.priority` re-triaged). State changes update the value, not the tag set.

State-as-tag is the anti-pattern — a `resolved`, `closed`, or `draft` tag conflates identity and state, because rewriting `document.tags` to track lifecycle churns the identity axis. Use a `document.status` property instead. The reverse also holds: do not invent a `document.type: <kind>` property to duplicate signal the type tag already carries.

Canonical example — dotted form:

```yaml
---
title: Property graphs
summary: Notes on the property-graph data model and SQLite-vs-native tradeoffs.
document.tags: [graph-db, note]
document.created: 2026-05-25
document.status: draft
---
```

The same document in nested form (the corpus convention), with an `edge.<stereotype>` line shown dotted alongside the nested `document:` block:

```yaml
---
title: Property graphs
summary: Notes on the property-graph data model and SQLite-vs-native tradeoffs.
document:
  tags: [graph-db, note]
  created: 2026-05-25
  status: draft
edge.supports: [docs/notes/sqlite-hybrid.md]
---
```
