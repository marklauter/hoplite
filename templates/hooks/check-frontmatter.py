"""PostToolUse hook: warn when a .md file under docs/ is written without valid Hoplite frontmatter.

Exits 2 with an advisory on stderr so Claude Code surfaces the warning to the agent as
tool-result feedback. The write is not rolled back; the agent is expected to follow up
with an Edit that prepends or corrects the frontmatter block.

Validation is line-scan based — no PyYAML dependency, since the hook runs under
whatever ``python`` is on PATH, not the hoplite project's venv. The indexer at reindex
is the authoritative validator (it parses YAML for real and checks types); this hook
catches the structural issues that are cheap to detect:

- Missing opening ``---`` fence.
- Missing closing ``---`` fence.
- Any of the four mandatory keys (title, summary, tags, created) absent.

Wrong types, typos in keys, malformed YAML — left to the indexer.

The canonical guidance shown in the advisory is inlined at build time from
``templates/components/shape/frontmatter.md`` so the hook and the writing skills
teach exactly the same shape.
